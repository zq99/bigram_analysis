# Bigram Frequency Analysis

This code extracts all the Bigrams from a list of 9,000 of the most common words in English. 

The idea is to count the frequency of each bigram at each position in a word and see the distribution relative to all appearances of that Bigram in the word list.

A Bigram is two consecutive characters in a word.

For example, the word "hello" has 4 Bigrams: "he", "el", "ll", "lo".
