# Bigram Frequency Analysis

A Bigram represents two consecutive characters. 

The word "hello" has 4 Bigrams: "he", "el", "ll", "lo".

This code extracts all the bigrams from a list of 9,000 of the most common words in English. 

The idea is to count the frequency of each bigram at each position in a word and see the distribution relative to all appearences of that Bigram in the word list.
